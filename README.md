# CHAT APP & SERVER
This is a school assignment project. I decided to make a chatapp with a client and a server. The gui is made in wpf.
A few months ago, i made a similar app. So i wanted to expand on my knowledge and add better functions to this version.

Early on in the project, i made this design in xaml. But i soon realized that some of the pieces i used, didnt have the nessecary presets or settings that i needed to link the design with the backend part.<br>

I made this diagram before starting the project, to show a rough idea of the function of the app.
