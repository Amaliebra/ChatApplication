# CHAT APP & SERVER
This is a assignment project. I decided to make a chatapp with a client and a server. The gui is made in wpf.
A few months ago, i made a similar app. So i wanted to expand on my knowledge and add better functions to this version.
Here are some of the functions im "planning" to include, depending on how smooth the process will be:
- Sounds based on events.
- Additional view (Maybe a small window of some sort. Hopefully)
- Some form of way to handle username. Either given at random(placeholder) or type in username, with no requirements(Also placeholder with no saving)
- encryption (end to end? Api possibly. Probably wont focus on this).
- try to use it off local internet.(probably not going to happen within the deadline) <br>

### Challanges with the project
- I wanted to use async. I had heard async would work better with multiple clients. And it was a real challenge going from what i used in my previous project. Changing everything just to try to get the async to work.
- I had difficulties finding the source of the issues i had, as it was hard debugging. Evident by the number of debug writeLines in the project.

Early on in the project, i made this design in xaml. But i soon realized that some of the pieces i used, didnt have the nessecary presets or settings that i needed to link the design with the backend part.<br>

I made this diagram before starting the project, to show a rough idea of the function of the app.
